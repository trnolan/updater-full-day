On every call get list of sub-dirs
Iterate through each client sub-dir (Extract out user_id from file_dir)
If files in sub-dir call data_extractor API using requests with file location.
On receipt of proper return (i.e. 200 response) move file into archive directory structure outside of base location
If no proper return, do nothing ( will get it on next call)

def process()
try:
	requests.post(user_id, file_location)
	if response == 200:
		move_file_archive()

def move_file_archive()

move_file to client_archive
